# Patterns
## Aim
To print pascals triangle in C
## Theory
In programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code until a specified condition is met.

C programming has three types of loops:

    for loop
    while loop
    do...while loop
A pattern is generated when a nested loop repeats a set of printing statements. Patterns can also be formed by using conditional statements in between iterative statements.
